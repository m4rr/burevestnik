Truly offline chat.

## Alpha

Truly offline chat via Bonjour discovery.

Launch the app on the 2 iOS devices, compose a message on the first one, wait 3 secs -- it will appear on the second one.

Download: [Release 1.0-alpha](https://github.com/m4rr/burevestnik/releases/tag/v1.0).

## [WIP] Beta

Truly offline chat via Multipeer Connectivity.

Would be smarter and would have much more optimal routes to deliver messages.
